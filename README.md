## Summary

Supporting material for [[1]](#1)
which has been submitted to Geophysical Journal International. These codes are sufficient to reproduce all calculations and figures
within the  paper. This can be done either with the Jupyter notebook, MakeFigures.ipynb, or using the Python script, MakeFigures.py,
which saves the figures to a chosen directory. 

Functions needed to solve the (generalised) fingerprint problem are contained in SLmod.py. Also included is RFmod.py which contains functions
for generating Gaussian random fields on a sphere; these are, optionally, used within the main scripts to test the methods against
random changes of ice thickness.

Values for the present day sea level and ice thickness have been taken from the
model ICE6G of [[2]](#2) and [[3]](#3) . See https://www.atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca/~peltier/data.php for more details.

Tidal and (generalised) loading Love numbers have been pre-calculated for PREM [[4]](#4) using a Fortran code that can be found
within  https://github.com/da380/gia3D.git. 

If you make use of these codes within your own work, an acknowledgement would be appreciated along with a citation to [[1]](#1) when/if it is published. 

## Dependencies
